# rootdevs
The container we use for our reliability team interview work sample.
## AWS-S3-terraform

Terraform module which create S3 bucket on AWS with atmost features provided by Terraform AWS provider.
We can also add additional inputs like policy, logging, replication etc. as per system design. 

# Solution

Here we used for_each to iterate over same definition to create multiple buckets as per system design. It supports different configuartions for each bucket.

Currently these features are supported:-

1. versioning
2. access control
3. lifecycle rules
4. server-side encryption

# Key Takeoffs

* This solution is not limited to creation of three buckets only. One can extend and add as many buckets as needed.
* Variables are used to decouple artifacts from root definition file to make it robust and easily expandable.
* Bucket name contain random string to make it identical and unique.
* Each bucket can be created with different configuarions.

# Terraform versions

Terraform 0.13 and above are supported

# AWS version

AWS version ~3.0 is supported
